# Vsb Course - OOP - 2020

Welcome, this project is dedicated to a course that I am teaching on VSB TU Ostrava and will cover all code snippets that will be presented on each lecture.

## Lectures

## Literature
Go to [literature page](Literature.md) for complete list.

## Disclaimer

All codes that are written in this repository are just snippets and I do not guarantee their correctness. Even though I tried to make them correct there could be things that cannot be interpreted without context or simply there was not enough time to fix it.

:warning: If you find anything that can be fixed or modified, feel free to create PR with changes.
