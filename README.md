In this lecture, we will briefly look into C++ basics and OOP introduction.
The main purpose of this lecture is to look at the first OOP code snippets.

In this lecture, we will continue with very simple examples to practice some of the new introduced techniques and terms. For example we will explore options of getters, setters and constructors.

### Excercises
* Dictionary: Array of KeyValues objects
* Point: Class holding information about coordinates X and Y
* Curve: Class that holds list of points and can add new points to array

## Lecture 4:

In this lecture we will implement two separate examples and try to practice some known principles. 
So far lot of excercies was in code-along model, now we will try unassisted coding.
