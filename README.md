# Vsb Course - OOP - 2020

Welcome :wave:, this project is dedicated to a course that I am teaching on VSB TU Ostrava and will cover all code snippets that will be presented on each lecture.

## Content

- [All lectures](Lectures.md)
  - [Lecture 1 - Basics, first class](Lectures.md#lecture-1)
  - [Lecture 2 - Pointers](Lectures.md#lecture-2)
  - [Lecture 3 - Arrays, Dictionary, Point & Curve ](Lectures.md#lecture-3)

## Tasks

1) [Inheritance](Task1.md)

## Literature :book:
Go to [literature page](Literature.md) for complete list. Literature listed there is my personal selection and it does not reflect recomended literature from subject curriculum.

## Disclaimer :warning:

All codes that are written in this repository are just snippets and I do not guarantee their correctness. Even though I tried to make them correct there could be things that cannot be interpreted without context or simply there was not enough time to fix it :see_no_evil:.

## Contribution :dog:

If you find anything that can be fixed or modified, feel free to create PR with changes.
